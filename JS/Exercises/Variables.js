//Variable types:
    // Var => Aren't used anymore because it applies global values to the variable name and may cause a conflict
    // Let => These are the most common used to variables that have a shifting value because, it can get its value changed at will, like a score on a game
    // Const => Const are the type that serves as a reference into a system, library, page etc since it can't get assigned a new valued without being remade
